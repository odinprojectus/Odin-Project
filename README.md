# Odin-Project
A place for me to track my progress in the Odin Project.

Week -1:
Set up VirtualBox running Xubuntu, as well as Git and VS. Completed Prerequisites and Git Basics modules.

Week 1, 2025:
Completed HTML foundations. Early exposure to 'web design' and custom Runescape servers as a kid is paying off at this point.
